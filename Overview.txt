This project recreates the classic Knight Rider / KITT scanning light effect using Arduino Uno and multiple LEDs.
The lights sweep back and forth smoothly, creating a dynamic animation similar to the iconic car from the Knight Rider series.

Features:
- Smooth left–right scanning LED effect
- Adjustable delay for controlling LED speed
- Uses an array to easily manage multiple LEDs
- Beginner-friendly and well-structured code

Hardware Requirements:
- Arduino Uno
- 10–12 LEDs (or more)
- 220Ω resistors
- Jumper wires (male to male; n+1 wires where n is the number of led)
- Breadboard
- Potentiometer (Optional)
